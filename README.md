# Medical Insurance Cost Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and building a predictive 
model for medical insurance costs. It explores key factors influencing 
healthcare expenses and demonstrates data manipulation and analysis in Python 
using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Structure
* `Medical_Insurance_Cost (1).ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all 
code, analysis, and explanations.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python libraries required to run the notebook.
* `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git (e.g., 
temporary files, environment folders).
* `README.md`: This project overview.

## How to Run the Project
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone 
[https://github.com/camdenlehr/medical-insurance-cost-analysis-.git](https://github.com/camdenlehr/medical-insurance-cost-analysis-.git)
    cd medical-insurance-cost-analysis-
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
5.  Open `Medical_Insurance_Cost (1).ipynb` in your browser.

## Data Source
The project uses a synthetic dataset of medical insurance costs, including 
features like age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.

## Analysis Highlights
* **Initial Data Exploration:** Understanding the structure and basic 
statistics of the dataset.
* **Cost Calculation:** Deriving insurance costs based on various factors.
* **Data Aggregation:** Combining and structuring patient data into a 
comprehensive record system.
* **Patient Retrieval:** Demonstrating how to access and display specific 
patient records.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Basic Python data structures (dictionaries, lists)
